## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
f<- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/difiore/ada-datasets/main/IMDB-movies.csv"
d<- read_csv(f, col_names = TRUE)
head(d)
names(d)
view(d$genres)
unique(d$genres)
challenge<- d %>%
  mutate(comedy = if_else(str_detect(genres, "Comedy"), TRUE, FALSE))
challenge
challenge2<- challenge %>%
  summarise(Total_movies = n(), comedies = sum(comedy, na.rm = TRUE))
challenge<- challenge %>%
  mutate(rating = case_when(
    averageRating < 3.3 ~ "low",
    averageRating < 6.7 ~ "med",
    averageRating <= 10 ~ "high"
  ))
challenge4<- challenge %>%
  group_by(rating) %>%
  summarise(count = n(), averagerun = mean(runtimeMinutes, na.rm = TRUE))

for (i in 1:nrow(d)) {if(!is.na(d[i,]$runtimeMinutes)) print(i)}
```

Wordle creation challenge

```{r}
f<- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/difiore/ada-datasets/main/papers.csv"
p<- read_csv(f, col_names = TRUE)
names(p)
view(p)
author<- tibble(
  fullName = c("Abbott, David"),
  lastName = c("Abbott"), firstName = c("David"))
#inner join on papers
inner_join(p, author,
           by = c("First Author Last Name" = "lastName", "First Author First Name" = "firstName"))

```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
